## Uses

<!-- Address questions around how the model is intended to be used, including the foreseeable users of the model and those affected by the model. -->

### Direct Use

<!-- This section is for the model use without fine-tuning or plugging into a larger ecosystem/app. -->

The model is intended for solving math problems presented in English. It generates reasoning steps and an answer, formatted in XML tags. It can be used as a standalone tool for math problem-solving or integrated into a larger application.

### Downstream Use [optional]

<!-- This section is for the model use when fine-tuned for a task, or when plugged into a larger ecosystem/app -->

The model can be further fine-tuned on other math datasets or used as a component in a more complex system that requires mathematical reasoning.

### Out-of-Scope Use

<!-- This section addresses misuse, malicious use, and uses that the model will not work well for. -->

The model is specifically trained for math problem-solving. It may not perform well on tasks outside of this domain, such as general language understanding or generation. It may also struggle with math problems that require knowledge outside of the training data.

## Bias, Risks, and Limitations

<!-- This section is meant to convey both technical and sociotechnical limitations. -->

The model's performance is limited by the quality and quantity of the training data. It may exhibit biases present in the gsm8k dataset. The model's ability to generalize to unseen math problems is also limited.

### Recommendations

<!-- This section is meant to convey recommendations with respect to the bias, risk, and technical limitations. -->

Users (both direct and downstream) should be made aware of the risks, biases and limitations of the model. More information needed for further recommendations.

## How to Get Started with the Model

Use the code below to get started with the model.

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

# First, load the base model architecture
base_model = "Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct"
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    base_model,
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    device_map="auto",
    trust_remote_code=True
)

# Load the fine-tuned weights
checkpoint_path = "outputs/Qwen-0.5B-GRPO/checkpoint-1868"  # Specific checkpoint folder
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    checkpoint_path,
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    device_map="auto",
    trust_remote_code=True
)

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(
    checkpoint_path,
    trust_remote_code=True
)

# Rest of the inference code remains the same
SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
Respond in the following format:
<reasoning>
...
</reasoning>
<answer>
...
</answer>
"""

def solve_math_problem(question: str):
    prompt = [
        {"role": "system", "content": SYSTEM_PROMPT},
        {"role": "user", "content": question}
    ]

    input_text = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
        prompt,
        tokenize=False,
        add_generation_prompt=True
    )

    inputs = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)
    outputs = model.generate(
        **inputs,
        max_new_tokens=200,
        temperature=0.7,
        num_return_sequences=1,
        pad_token_id=tokenizer.pad_token_id,
        eos_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id
    )

    response = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
    return response

# Test with a sample problem
test_question = "A train travels at 60 miles per hour. If the journey is 270 miles long, how many hours will the trip take?"
print("\nQuestion:", test_question)
print("\nResponse:", solve_math_problem(test_question))
```
