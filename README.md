# GRPO Fine-Tuning Demo Roadmap

This document provides an in-depth roadmap for fine-tuning a LLaMA 1B model using the GRPO (Gradient Reward Policy Optimization) method. It also outlines planned enhancements for performance monitoring, a companion Colab notebook for inference testing, and future directions.

---

## Overview

This project demonstrates a self-contained fine-tuning script, `grpo_demo.py`, which uses the GRPO approach to fine-tune a LLaMA 1B (or Qwen 1.5B when applicable) model (base provided by Ollama 1B) on a GSM8K-based dataset. Although the GRPO method is generally more complex, this prototype has been streamlined into a single training script.

The training process leverages:
- **Transformers** for model and tokenizer functionality.
- **Datasets** (via Hugging Face) for data ingestion.
- **TRL (Transformer Reinforcement Learning)** for GRPO training.
- **PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning)** (currently available but commented out) for potential modular enhancements.
- **WandB** integration for logging performance metrics (with a possibility to integrate TensorBoard/gradio dashboards).

---

## Dependencies

The following key libraries and frameworks are used:
- **torch**: For tensor computations and model training.
- **transformers**: To load the pre-trained model and tokenizer.
- **datasets**: For loading and processing the training dataset.
- **peft**: For low-resource, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (optional/in progress).
- **trl**: Provides the GRPO training framework.
- **wandb**: Used for logging training metrics.
- **re** (Python standard library): For reward function and format checking.

> **Note:** Environment variables and API keys are managed via the `.env` file.

## Dataset Overview

We use a variant of the GSM8K dataset, adapted to match the Stoney Nakoda Q&A dataset characteristics. Key dataset fields include:
- **question**: Contains the user prompt.
- **answer**: Contains the expected answer (extracted via a hash-based or XML format).
- **generated_at**: Timestamp metadata.
- **pair_id**: Unique identifier for each Q&A pair.

The dataset is processed with custom functions to format prompts (with XML chain-of-thought cues) and extract answers, ensuring consistency and structure.

## Training Performance Monitoring

### Current Setup
The training script (`grpo_demo.py`) uses `wandb` for logging metrics. Logging is configured (e.g., `logging_steps=1`), providing frequent updates on training progress.

### Planned Enhancements
To further visualize performance during training, we plan to:
- **Integrate TensorBoard**: Utilize `torch.utils.tensorboard.SummaryWriter` for real-time visualization of loss curves, training dynamics, and resource usage.
- **Explore Gradio Dashboards**: Investigate if Gradio can provide a lightweight interface for live training monitoring or integrate existing Hugging Face tools for this purpose.
- **Dashboard Callbacks**: Modify the training loop (or GRPOTrainer callbacks) to emit additional metrics (e.g., loss, gradient norms, learning rate changes) to the chosen dashboard.

All proposed modifications are documented here as groundwork for future enhancements.

## Companion Colab Notebook

A companion Colab notebook will be created that:
- **Loads the Fine-Tuned Model**: Provides code cells for loading the model and tokenizer.
- **Runs Inference Tests**: Allows users to input prompts and observe model responses interactively.
- **Displays Live Performance Metrics**: Embeds code to visualize training performance using libraries like Matplotlib, Plotly, or integrated dashboard tools from Hugging Face.
- **Contains Step-by-Step Instructions**: Guides users through replicating the training environment, setting up API keys, and running inference.

## Academic-Level Discussion & Future Directions

In the spirit of rigorous academic inquiry, this roadmap contextualizes our GRPO-based fine-tuning within frameworks found in [archivx](https://archivx.org). Key discussion points include:
- **Theoretical Background**: A review of reward-driven policy optimization and its adaptation for language model fine-tuning.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Insights on how this streamlined approach compares with more complex GRPO implementations.
- **Parameter Efficiency**: Discussion on the role and future enhancements using PEFT.
- **Community-in-the-Loop**: Outlining the potential for iterative refinement with community feedback and continual learning.

Future work will examine:
- Expanding the dataset (e.g., finalizing an 85k line version).
- Fine-tuning on larger models and comparing performance.
- Detailed analysis of training metrics and visualizations to drive further methodological refinements.
- Potential integration with Gradio or Hugging Face performance tools for enhanced monitoring.

## Conclusion

This roadmap sets forth a comprehensive plan for understanding the current code, evaluating the data structure used for fine-tuning, and building enhancements to monitor overall performance â€“ both in the training script and via a companion Colab notebook. The document serves as a guide for both immediate implementation improvements and long-term research directions in low-resource language model fine-tuning.

Happy fine-tuning!
