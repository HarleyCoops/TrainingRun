# GRPO Fine-Tuning Demo Roadmap

## Quickstart

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```

2. **Set up the environment:**
   - Install Python dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - Ensure your `.env` file is configured with your API keys (e.g., WandB API key).

3. **Run the training script:**
   ```bash
   python grpo_demo.py
   ```
   This will start the training process and log metrics to Weights & Biases.

4. **For Notebook Users:**
   - Open the companion Colab notebook `colab_notebook.ipynb` to load the fine-tuned model, run inference tests, and visualize performance metrics interactively.

Enjoy experimenting with the GRPO fine-tuning demo!

This document provides an in-depth roadmap for fine-tuning a LLaMA 1B model using the GRPO (Gradient Reward Policy Optimization) method. It also outlines planned enhancements for performance monitoring, a companion Colab notebook for inference testing, and future directions.

## Overview

This project demonstrates a self-contained fine-tuning script, `grpo_demo.py`, which uses the GRPO approach to fine-tune a LLaMA 1B (or Qwen 1.5B when applicable) model (base provided by Ollama 1B) on a GSM8K-based dataset. Although the GRPO method is generally more complex, this prototype has been streamlined into a single training script.

The training process leverages:
- **Transformers** for model and tokenizer functionality.
- **Datasets** (via Hugging Face) for data ingestion.
- **TRL (Transformer Reinforcement Learning)** for GRPO training.
- **PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning)** (currently available but commented out) for potential modular enhancements.
- **WandB** integration for logging performance metrics (with a possibility to integrate TensorBoard/gradio dashboards).

---

## Dependencies

The following key libraries and frameworks are used:
- **torch**: For tensor computations and model training.
- **transformers**: To load the pre-trained model and tokenizer.
- **datasets**: For loading and processing the training dataset.
- **peft**: For low-resource, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (optional/in progress).
- **trl**: Provides the GRPO training framework.
- **wandb**: Used for logging training metrics.
- **re** (Python standard library): For reward function and format checking.

> **Note:** Environment variables and API keys are managed via the `.env` file.

## Dataset Overview

We use a variant of the GSM8K dataset, adapted to match the Stoney Nakoda Q&A dataset characteristics. Key dataset fields include:
- **question**: Contains the user prompt.
- **answer**: Contains the expected answer (extracted via a hash-based or XML format).
- **generated_at**: Timestamp metadata.
- **pair_id**: Unique identifier for each Q&A pair.

The dataset is processed with custom functions to format prompts (with XML chain-of-thought cues) and extract answers, ensuring consistency and structure.

## Training Performance Monitoring

### Current Setup
The training script (`grpo_demo.py`) uses Weights & Biases (WandB) for logging metrics. Logging is configured to provide frequent updates on training progress, including hyperparameters, system metrics, and live training stats.

### Weights & Biases Integration
Weights & Biases' tools enable you to quickly track experiments, visualize results, and identify model regressions. The integration involves:
- **Installation**: Install the WandB library (`pip install wandb`).
- **Setup**: Log in using `wandb login` with your API key (stored in the .env file).
- **Logging**: The training script initializes a WandB run with configuration details (e.g., learning rate, batch size, epochs, run name). During training, relevant metrics such as loss and accuracy are logged, allowing for real-time visualization within the WandB dashboard.
- **Example Code**:
  ```python
  import wandb
  wandb.init(
      project="GRPO-Fine-Tuning",
      config={
           "learning_rate": training_args.learning_rate,
           "adam_beta1": training_args.adam_beta1,
           "adam_beta2": training_args.adam_beta2,
           "weight_decay": training_args.weight_decay,
           "warmup_ratio": training_args.warmup_ratio,
           "batch_size": training_args.per_device_train_batch_size,
           "num_train_epochs": training_args.num_train_epochs,
           "run_name": training_args.run_name
      }
  )
  ```
- **Tracking**: As the model trains, WandB logs are updated in real time, allowing you to monitor training dynamics and system performance.

### Planned Enhancements
Beyond the current WandB setup, additional monitoring improvements include:
- **Integrate TensorBoard**: Use `torch.utils.tensorboard.SummaryWriter` as an alternative or supplementary visualization tool.
- **Explore Gradio Dashboards**: Investigate the use of Gradio for interactive live monitoring interfaces.
- **Enhanced Callbacks**: Expand logging to capture additional metrics such as gradient norms, learning rate changes, and custom performance indicators.

## Companion Colab Notebook

A companion Colab notebook will be created that:
- **Loads the Fine-Tuned Model**: Provides code cells for loading the model and tokenizer.
- **Runs Inference Tests**: Allows users to input prompts and observe model responses interactively.
- **Displays Live Performance Metrics**: Embeds code to visualize training performance using libraries like Matplotlib, Plotly, or integrated dashboard tools from Hugging Face.
- **Contains Step-by-Step Instructions**: Guides users through replicating the training environment, setting up API keys, and running inference.

## Academic-Level Discussion & Future Directions

In the spirit of rigorous academic inquiry, this roadmap contextualizes our GRPO-based fine-tuning within frameworks found in [archivx](https://archivx.org). Key discussion points include:
- **Theoretical Background**: A review of reward-driven policy optimization and its adaptation for language model fine-tuning.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Insights on how this streamlined approach compares with more complex GRPO implementations.
- **Parameter Efficiency**: Discussion on the role and future enhancements using PEFT.
- **Community-in-the-Loop**: Outlining the potential for iterative refinement with community feedback and continual learning.

Future work will examine:
- Expanding the dataset (e.g., finalizing an 85k line version).
- Fine-tuning on larger models and comparing performance.
- Detailed analysis of training metrics and visualizations to drive further methodological refinements.
- Potential integration with Gradio or Hugging Face performance tools for enhanced monitoring.

## Conclusion

This roadmap sets forth a comprehensive plan for understanding the current code, evaluating the data structure used for fine-tuning, and building enhancements to monitor overall performance â€“ both in the training script and via a companion Colab notebook. The document serves as a guide for both immediate implementation improvements and long-term research directions in low-resource language model fine-tuning.

Happy fine-tuning!
